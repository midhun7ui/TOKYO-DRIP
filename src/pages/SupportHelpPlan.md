# Support Page Redesign Plan

## Design Goals
- **Premium Aesthetic**: Dark theme, glassmorphism, subtle gradients.
- **Components**:
    - **Hero Section**: "How can we help?" with a search bar (visual only).
    - **FAQ Grid**: Common questions in a clean grid layout.
    - **Contact Form**: Glass card with input fields for Name, Email, Subject, Message.
    - **Contact Info**: Visual cards for Email, Chat, and Showroom support.

## Implementation Steps
1.  **Update Support.jsx**: Replace current placeholder with the new layout.
2.  **Update App.css**: Add specific styles for the support grid, form inputs, and glass cards.
